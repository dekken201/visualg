Exercises solved using VisualG 2.0, a brazillian program used to teach programming. It is extremely simplified and limited, but very useful for newbies. It is written in PT-BR and so, generally all explanations are in pt-br as well. If anyone actually bothers reading it, I can translate some stuff or at least explain what some words mean.
